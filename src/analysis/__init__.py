# This file makes the 'analysis' directory a Python package.

# Other components like VideoAnalyzer, ScoringEngine, RecommendationEngine
# should be imported directly from their modules by consumers to avoid 
# potential circular imports if they depend on API clients, which in turn
# might import from this 'analysis' package (e.g., for schemas).
# Example: from src.analysis.video_analyzer import VideoAnalyzer

    # or instruct users to import them directly from their submodules.
